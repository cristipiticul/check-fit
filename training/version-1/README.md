Training code for Plank and Holding Squat

Inspired from https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/community/en/flowers_tf_lite.ipynb

Only a sample of the dataset is available. For the full dataset, please contact me at cristipiticul@gmail.com

Note: the pictures are rotated because they were captured directly from the app (without any preprocessing). This was done to ensure training has same preprocessing as the Android app.
