This is work-in-progress

Inspired from https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/community/en/flowers_tf_lite.ipynb and https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/data_augmentation

Changes from version-1: new dataset:
- Added more backgrounds
- Added more mistakes
- Contains only plank images
- Reduced the number of very similar images (replaced with automatic data augmentation)

Only the metadata of the dataset is available. For the full dataset, please contact me at cristipiticul@gmail.com
